                <h1>Creator of Linux Kernel</h1>
                <p>Linus Torvalds created the Linux kernel and oversees open source development of the widely-used Linux operating system.</p>
                <p>Torvalds was born on 28 December 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He enrolled at the University of Helsinki in 1988, graduating with a master’s degree in computer science. His M.Sc. thesis was titled Linux: A Portable Operating System.</p>
                <h1 id="open-txt">Open-Source Advocate</h1>
                <p>Torvalds has carefully overseen the development of Linux since its inception. In 2003, he focused exclusively on the kernel, backed by the Open Source Development Labs (OSDL), a consortium formed by high-tech companies which included IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, AMD, RedHat, Novell and many others. The purpose of the consortium was to promote Linux development. OSDL merged with The Free Standards Group in January 2007, to become The Linux Foundation. As the self-described “benevolent dictator of Planet Linux,” Torvalds remains the ultimate authority on what new code is incorporated into the standard Linux kernel.</p>
